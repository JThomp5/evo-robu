# evo-robu
Testing the robustness of evolution detection techniques when node labels are removed from the network.

TODO:
	Write program that takes a temporal community structure ( communities at each time slice ) as input, and outputs the same community structure with a random \lambda percentage of the node labels removed ( or changes to 'unknown' or some equivalent )
	      - Choose the nodes to remove randomly
	      - Go through files again, converting
